 intro
   1st place @ mekka/symposium 2k-1. we are too tired to write any sensible
   stuff now. so please excuse very bad quality of this info file. it is even
   possible that the included source-code is corrupted. but as most of the
   sceners think our code suxx anyway, and asm sucks, it might be no problem
   for you. we are very glad about that. 

 featuring
   real-time graphics code
   real-time sound code
   precalculated speech synthesis + vocoder
